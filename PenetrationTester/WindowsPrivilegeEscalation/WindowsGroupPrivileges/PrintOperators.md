# Print Operators
Print Operators is another highly privileged group, which grants its members the `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, rights to manage, create, share, and delete printers connected to a Domain Controller, as well as the ability to log on locally to a Domain Controller and shut it down. If we issue the command `whoami /priv`, and don't see the `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` from an unelevated context, we will need to bypass UAC.

## Checking Privileges
The [UACMe](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME) repo features a comprehensive list of UAC bypasses, which can be used from the command line. Alternatively, from a GUI, we can open an administrative command shell and input the credentials of the account that is a member of the Print Operators group. If we examine the privileges again, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` is visible but disabled.

```cmd
C:\htb> whoami /priv

It's well known that the driver `Capcom.sys` contains functionality to allow any user to execute shellcode with SYSTEM privileges. We can use our privileges to load this vulnerable driver and escalate privileges. We can use [this tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3gstudent/Homework-of-C-Language/master/EnableSeLoadDriverPrivilege.cpp) to load the driver. The PoC enables the privilege as well as loads the driver for us.

Download it locally and edit it, pasting over the includes below.

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <winternl.h>
#include <sddl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "tchar.h"
```

## Compile with cl.exe
Next, from a Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt, compile it using `cl.exe`.

```cmd
