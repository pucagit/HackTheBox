# Nessus
To download Nessus, we can navigate to its [Download Page](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true) to download the correct Nessus binary for our system. We will be downloading the Debian package for Ubuntu for this walkthrough.

Next, we can visit the [Activation Code Page](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/activation-code) to request a Nessus Activation Code, which is necessary to get the free version of Nessus.

With both the binary and activation code in hand, we can now install the Nessus package:
```
$ dpkg -i Nessus-8.15.1-ubuntu910_amd64.deb
```

Once we have Nessus installed, we can start the Nessus Service:
```
$ sudo systemctl start nessusd.service
```

To access Nessus, we can navigate to https://localhost:8834. Once we arrive at the setup page, we should select Nessus Essentials for the free version, and then we can enter our activation code.
