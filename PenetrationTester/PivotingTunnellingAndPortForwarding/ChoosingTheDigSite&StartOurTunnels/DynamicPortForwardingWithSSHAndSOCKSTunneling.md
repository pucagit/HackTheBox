# Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH and SOCKS Tunneling
## Port Forwarding in Context
**Port forwarding** is a technique that allows us to redirect a communication request from one port to another. Port forwarding uses TCP as the primary communication layer to provide interactive communication for the forwarded port. However, different application layer protocols such as SSH or even SOCKS (non-application layer) can be used to encapsulate the forwarded traffic. This can be effective in bypassing firewalls and using existing services on your compromised host to pivot to other networks.

### Scanning the Pivot Target

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sT -p22,3306 10.129.202.64

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-24 12:12 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.202.64
Host is up (0.12s latency).

PORT     STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp   open   ssh
3306/tcp closed mysql

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.68 seconds
```

### Executing the Local Port Forward

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 ubuntu@10.129.202.64

The `-L` command tells the SSH client to request the SSH server to forward all the data we send via the port **1234** to **localhost:3306** on the Ubuntu server. By doing this, we should be able to access the MySQL service locally on port 1234.

### Confirming Port Forward with Netstat

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ netstat -antp | grep 1234

(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
 will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:1234          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      4034/ssh

```

### Confirming Port Forward with Nmap

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ nmap -v -sV -p1234 localhost

### Forwarding Multiple Ports

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```

## Dynamic Port Forwarding
Unlike the previous scenario where we knew which port to access, in many scenarios, we don't know which services lie on the other side of the network. We cannot perform a nmap scan directly from our attack host because it does not have routes to the target network. To do this, we will have to perform **dynamic port forwarding** and **pivot** our network packets via the Ubuntu server. We can do this by starting a **SOCKS listener** on our local host (personal attack host or Pwnbox) and then configure SSH to forward that traffic via SSH to the target network after connecting to the target host.

This is called **SSH tunneling over SOCKS proxy**. **SOCKS** stands for **Socket Secure**, a protocol that helps communicate with servers where you have firewall restrictions in place. Unlike most cases where you would initiate a connection to connect to a service, in the case of SOCKS, the initial traffic is generated by a SOCKS client, which connects to the SOCKS server controlled by the user (here is the attack host) who wants to access a service on the client-side. Once the connection is established, network traffic can be routed through the SOCKS server on behalf of the connected client.

One more benefit of using SOCKS proxy for pivoting and forwarding data is that SOCKS proxies can pivot via creating a route to an external server from **NAT networks**. SOCKS proxies are currently of two types: **SOCKS4** and **SOCKS5**. **SOCKS4** doesn't provide any authentication and UDP support, whereas **SOCKS5** does provide that.

### Enabling Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```

The `-D` argument requests the SSH server to enable dynamic port forwarding. Once we have this enabled, we will require a tool that can route any tool's packets over the port `9050`. We can do this using the tool `proxychains`, which is capable of redirecting TCP connections through **TOR**, **SOCKS**, and **HTTP/HTTPS** proxy servers and also allows us to chain multiple proxy servers together. Using proxychains, we can hide the IP address of the requesting host as well since the receiving host will only see the IP of the pivot host. 

### Checking /etc/proxychains.conf
To inform proxychains that we must use port 9050, we must modify the proxychains configuration file located at /etc/proxychains.conf. We can add socks4 127.0.0.1 9050 to the last line if it is not already there.

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ tail -4 /etc/proxychains.conf

# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
socks4  127.0.0.1 9050
```

### Using Nmap with Proxychains
Now when you start Nmap with proxychains using the below command, it will route all the packets of Nmap to the local port 9050, where our SSH client is listening, which will forward all the packets over SSH to the 172.16.5.0/23 network.

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ proxychains nmap -v -sn 172.16.5.1-200

```

This part of packing all your Nmap data using proxychains and forwarding it to a remote server is called **SOCKS tunneling.** One more important note to remember here is that we can only perform a **full TCP connect scan** over proxychains. The reason for this is that proxychains cannot understand partial packets. If you send partial packets like half connect scans, it will return incorrect results. We also need to make sure we are aware of the fact that host-alive checks may not work against Windows targets because the Windows Defender firewall blocks ICMP requests (traditional pings) by default.

### Using Metasploit with Proxychains

### Using xfreerdp with Proxychains

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123

The xfreerdp command will require an RDP certificate to be accepted before successfully establishing the session. After accepting it, we should have an RDP session, pivoting via the Ubuntu server.
