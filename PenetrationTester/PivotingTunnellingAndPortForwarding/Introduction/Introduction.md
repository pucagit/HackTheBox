# Introduction and The Networking Behind Pivoting

## Lateral Movement, Pivoting, and Tunneling Compared
### Lateral Movement
Lateral movement can be described as a technique used to further our access to additional **hosts**, **applications**, and **services** within a network environment. Lateral movement can also help us gain access to specific domain resources we may need to elevate our privileges. Lateral Movement often enables privilege escalation across hosts.

### Pivoting
Utilizing multiple hosts to cross **network** boundaries you would not usually have access to. The goal here is to allow us to move deeper into a network by compromising targeted hosts or infrastructure.

### Tunneling
We often find ourselves using various protocols to shuttle traffic in/out of a network where there is a chance of our traffic being detected. For example, using HTTP to mask our Command & Control traffic from a server we own to the victim host. The key here is obfuscation of our actions to avoid detection for as long as possible. These types of actions also enable tactics like the exfiltration of data out of a target network or the delivery of more payloads and instructions into the network.

## The Networking Behind Pivoting
### IP Addressing & NICs
Every computer that is communicating on a network needs an IP address. If it doesn't have one, it is not on a network. 

Whether assigned **dynamically** or **statically**, the IP address is assigned to a **Network Interface Controller (NIC)**. A computer can have multiple NICs (physical and virtual), meaning it can have multiple IP addresses assigned, allowing it to communicate on various networks.

Check for additional NICs using commands like `ifconfig` (in macOS and Linux) and `ipconfig` (in Windows).

```sh

### Routing
It is common to think of a network appliance that connects us to the Internet when thinking about a router, but technically any computer can become a router and participate in routing. One key defining characteristic of a router is that it has a routing table that it uses to forward traffic based on the destination IP address. Let's look at this on Pwnbox using the commands `netstat -r` or `ip route`:

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ netstat -r

Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
default         178.62.64.1     0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0
10.10.10.0      10.10.14.1      255.255.254.0   UG        0 0          0 tun0
10.10.14.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.254.0   U         0 0          0 tun0

10.129.0.0      10.10.14.1      255.255.0.0     UG        0 0          0 tun0
178.62.64.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.192.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
```

### Protocols, Services & Ports
**Protocols** are the rules that govern network communications. Many protocols and services have corresponding **ports** that act as identifiers. Logical ports aren't physical things we can touch or plug anything into. They are in software assigned to applications. When we see an IP address, we know it identifies a computer that may be reachable over a network. When we see an open port bound to that IP address, we know that it identifies an application we may be able to connect to. Connecting to specific ports that a device is **listening** on can often allow us to use ports & protocols that are **permitted** in the firewall to gain a foothold on the network.
