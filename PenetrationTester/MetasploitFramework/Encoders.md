# Encoders
Encoders have assisted with making payloads compatible with different processor architectures while at the same time helping with antivirus evasion. They are also needed to remove hexadecimal opcodes known as bad characters from the payload.

However nowadays, modern detection methods have caught up, and these encoded payloads are far from being universally undetectable anymore.
