# Windows Remote Management Protocols
Remote management is enabled by default starting with Windows Server 2016. The main components used for remote management of Windows and Windows servers are the following:

- Remote Desktop Protocol (`RDP`)
- Windows Remote Management (`WinRM`)
- Windows Management Instrumentation (`WMI`)

## RDP (port 3389)
RDP works at the application layer in the TCP/IP reference model, typically utilizing TCP port 3389 as the transport protocol. However, the connectionless UDP protocol can use port 3389 also for remote administration.

For an RDP session to be established, both the network firewall and the firewall on the server must allow connections from the outside. If Network Address Translation (NAT) is used on the route between client and server, as is often the case with Internet connections, the remote computer needs the public IP address to reach the server. In addition, port forwarding must be set up on the NAT router in the direction of the server.

CPAN.pm requires configuration, but most of it can be done automatically.
If you answer 'no' below, you will enter an interactive dialog for each
configuration option instead.

Would you like to configure as much as possible automatically? [yes] yes

We can connect to RDP servers on Linux using `xfreerdp`, `rdesktop`, or `Remmina` and interact with the GUI of the server accordingly.

## WinRM (ports 5985, 5986)
The Windows Remote Management (`WinRM`) is a simple Windows integrated remote management protocol based on the command line. WinRM uses the Simple Object Access Protocol (`SOAP`) to establish connections to remote hosts and their applications. Therefore, WinRM must be explicitly enabled and configured starting with Windows 10. WinRM relies on TCP ports 5985 and 5986 for communication, with the last port 5986 using HTTPS.

Another component that fits WinRM for administration is Windows Remote Shell (`WinRS`), which lets us execute arbitrary commands on the remote system. The program is even included on Windows 7 by default. Thus, with WinRM, it is possible to execute a remote command on another server.

### Footprinting
If we want to find out whether one or more remote servers can be reached via WinRM, we can easily do this with the help of PowerShell. The `Test-WsMan` cmdlet is responsible for this, and the host's name in question is passed to it. In Linux-based environments, we can use the tool called `evil-winrm`, another penetration testing tool designed to interact with WinRM.

## WMI (port 135)
WMI allows read and write access to almost all settings on Windows systems. WMI is typically accessed via PowerShell, VBScript, or the Windows Management Instrumentation Console (WMIC). WMI is not a single program but consists of several programs and various databases, also known as repositories.

### Footprinting
The initialization of the WMI communication always takes place on TCP port 135, and after the successful establishment of the connection, the communication is moved to a random port.
