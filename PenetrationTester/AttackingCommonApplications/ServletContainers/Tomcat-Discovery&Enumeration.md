# Tomcat - Discovery & Enumeration
Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server that hosts applications written in Java. Tomcat was initially designed to run Java Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP) scripts. However, its popularity increased in Java-based frameworks and is now widely used by frameworks such as Spring and tools such as Gradle. 

## Discovery/Footprinting
Tomcat servers can be identified by the Server header in the HTTP response. If the server is operating behind a reverse proxy, requesting an invalid page should reveal the server and version.

Another method of detecting a Tomcat server and version is through the `/docs` page. This is the default documentation page, which may not be removed by administrators. Here is the general folder structure of a Tomcat installation.

```
├── bin
├── conf
│   ├── catalina.policy
│   ├── catalina.properties
│   ├── context.xml
│   ├── tomcat-users.xml
│   ├── tomcat-users.xsd
│   └── web.xml
├── lib
├── logs
├── temp
├── webapps
│   ├── manager
│   │   ├── images
│   │   ├── META-INF
│   │   └── WEB-INF
|   |       └── web.xml
│   └── ROOT
│       └── WEB-INF
└── work
    └── Catalina
        └── localhost
```

The `bin` folder stores scripts and binaries needed to start and run a Tomcat server. The `conf` folder stores various configuration files used by Tomcat. The `tomcat-users.xml` file stores user credentials and their assigned roles. The `lib` folder holds the various JAR files needed for the correct functioning of Tomcat. The `logs` and `temp` folders store temporary log files. The `webapps` folder is the default webroot of Tomcat and hosts all the applications. The `work` folder acts as a cache and is used to store data during runtime.

Each folder inside `webapps` is expected to have the following structure.

```
webapps/customapp
├── images
├── index.jsp
├── META-INF
│   └── context.xml
├── status.xsd
└── WEB-INF
    ├── jsp
    |   └── admin.jsp
    └── web.xml
    └── lib
    |    └── jdbc_drivers.jar
    └── classes
        └── AdminServlet.class
```

The most important file among these is `WEB-INF/web.xml`, which is known as the deployment descriptor. This file stores information about the routes used by the application and the classes handling these routes. All compiled classes used by the application should be stored in the `WEB-INF/classes` folder. The `lib` folder stores the libraries needed by that particular application. The `jsp` folder stores Jakarta Server Pages (JSP), formerly known as `JavaServer Pages`, which can be compared to PHP files on an Apache server.

Here’s an example web.xml file.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

<!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN" "http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd">

<web-app>
  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>AdminServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>com.inlanefreight.api.AdminServlet</servlet-class>
  </servlet>

  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>AdminServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/admin</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
```

The `web.xml` configuration above defines a new servlet named `AdminServlet` that is mapped to the class `com.inlanefreight.api.AdminServlet`. 

Next, a new servlet mapping is created to map requests to `/admin` with `AdminServlet`. This configuration will send any request received for `/admin` to the `AdminServlet.class` class for processing. The `web.xml` descriptor holds a lot of sensitive information and is an important file to check when leveraging a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.

The `tomcat-users.xml` file is used to allow or disallow access to the `/manager` and `host-manager` admin pages.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<SNIP>
  
<tomcat-users xmlns="http://tomcat.apache.org/xml"
              xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
              xsi:schemaLocation="http://tomcat.apache.org/xml tomcat-users.xsd"
              version="1.0">
<!--
  By default, no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required
  to operate the "/manager/html" web application.  If you wish to use this app,
  you must define such a user - the username and password are arbitrary.

  Built-in Tomcat manager roles:
    - manager-gui    - allows access to the HTML GUI and the status pages
    - manager-script - allows access to the HTTP API and the status pages
    - manager-jmx    - allows access to the JMX proxy and the status pages
    - manager-status - allows access to the status pages only

  The users below are wrapped in a comment and are therefore ignored. If you
  wish to configure one or more of these users for use with the manager web
  application, do not forget to remove the <!.. ..> that surrounds them. You
  will also need to set the passwords to something appropriate.
-->

   
 <SNIP>
  
!-- user manager can access only manager section -->
<role rolename="manager-gui" />
<user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui" />

<!-- user admin can access manager and admin section both -->
<role rolename="admin-gui" />
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui" />


</tomcat-users>
```

## Enumeration
After fingerprinting the Tomcat instance, unless it has a known vulnerability, we'll typically want to look for the `/manager` and the `/host-manager` pages. We can attempt to locate these with a tool such as Gobuster or just browse directly to them.

```sh
$ gobuster dir -u http://web01.inlanefreight.local:8180/ -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt

```

We may be able to either log in to one of these using weak credentials such as `tomcat`:`tomcat`, `admin`:`admin`, etc. If these first few tries don't work, we can try a password brute force attack against the login page, covered in the next section. If we are successful in logging in, we can upload a [Web Application Resource or Web Application ARchive (WAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAR_(file_format)#:~:text=In%20software%20engineering%2C%20a%20WAR,that%20together%20constitute%20a%20web) file containing a JSP web shell and obtain remote code execution on the Tomcat server.

## Questions
1. What version of Tomcat is running on the application located at http://web01.inlanefreight.local:8180? **Answer: 10.0.10**
   - The version is visible at http://web01.inlanefreight.local:8180/docs/

   - Admin role at:
        ```xml
        <role rolename="admin-gui" />
        <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui" />
