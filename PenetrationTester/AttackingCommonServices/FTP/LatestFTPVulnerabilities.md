# Latest FTP Vulnerabilities
CoreFTP before build 727 vulnerability assigned [CVE-2022-22836](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22836). This vulnerability is for an FTP service that does not correctly process the HTTP `PUT` request and leads to an authenticated directory/path traversal, and arbitrary file write vulnerability. This vulnerability allows us to write files outside the directory to which the service has access.

```sh
$ curl -k -X PUT -H "Host: <IP>" --basic -u <username>:<password> --data-binary "PoC." --path-as-is https://<IP>/../../../../../../whoops
```

We create a raw HTTP `PUT` request (`-X PUT`) with basic auth (`--basic -u <username>:<password>`), the path for the file (`--path-as-is https://<IP>/../../../../../whoops`), and its content (`--data-binary "PoC."`) with this command. Additionally, we specify the host header (`-H "Host: <IP>"`) with the IP address of our target system.

In short, the actual process misinterprets the user's input of the path. This leads to access to the restricted folder being bypassed. As a result, the write permissions on the HTTP `PUT` request are not adequately controlled, which leads to us being able to create the files we want outside of the authorized folders.
